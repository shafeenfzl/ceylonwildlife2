Many rare plants are found here too, especially orchids and rhododendrons. <br><br>Nearly half the birds and four of the mammals found in Horton Plains are endemic species, highlighting its vital role in Sri Lankan biodiversity conservation.

It is named after the natural lakes or 'willus' that dot the park. It is home to leopards, sloth bears, elephants, and many other species of wildlife. The park has a dry semi-arid climate and a dense forest cover. It also has a historical significance, as it is the landing site of Prince Vijaya, the founder of the Sinhala nation. Wilpattu was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1905 and a national park in 1938."
